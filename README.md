Rules of the Game
Use your keyboard to cross the road. You can use your arrows or the preprogrammed letters to move your avatar on the screen. Help you avater move across the path without colliding with an obstacle. Get your avatar to the other side of the path to win the level.

Be careful or you'll lose a life if collide. Your game is over when you run out of hearts.

TODO
I plan to add achievement awards for successfully passing levels.
